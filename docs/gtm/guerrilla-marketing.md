# $SNITCH Guerrilla Marketing - Copy-Paste Ready

## REDDIT POSTS (post manually or give me API access)

### r/solana
**Title:** Built a Prisoner's Dilemma game where holders can literally steal from each other on-chain

**Body:**
Just shipped this for fun - every 24h, 2 random holders get selected. They choose COOPERATE or SNITCH privately.

- Both cooperate → +5% yield each
- One snitches → steals 50% of the other's bag  
- Both snitch → both lose 25% (burned)

All outcomes are public. Wallets tagged. It's basically a drama machine.

Live demo: https://randytorres.github.io/snitch-game/

Built on Anchor. Curious what you think about the game theory angle.

### r/CryptoMoonShots  
**Title:** $SNITCH - The Prisoner's Dilemma Token. Betray holders for yield. 🔪

**Body:**
🚨 New mechanic, not another dog coin.

Every 24 hours, 2 random holders are pulled into interrogation.
They secretly choose: COOPERATE or SNITCH.

**Payoffs:**
✅ Both cooperate = +5% yield each
🔪 One snitches = snitch takes 50% of victim's bag
💀 Both snitch = both lose 25%, burned forever

All results posted publicly. Wallet addresses. Receipts. Drama.

This isn't a community. It's a prison yard with a yield pool.

### r/defi
**Title:** Game theory experiment: Prisoner's Dilemma with real money on Solana

**Body:**
Built this as a thought experiment that got out of hand.

Classic PD payoff matrix but with actual tokens:
- Mutual cooperation: both get yield
- Defection: defector takes from cooperator
- Mutual defection: both lose (burn)

Selection is random via VRF. Choices committed via hash then revealed. All on-chain, all transparent.

The interesting part: watching trust dynamics emerge in a trustless system.
