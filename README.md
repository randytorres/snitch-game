# $SNITCH - The Prisoner's Dilemma Token

> Betray your fellow holders for yield. Get betrayed, lose everything.

## Status: 🚧 In Development

## Concept
- Every 24h, random "interrogation" selects 2 holders
- Each privately chooses: COOPERATE or SNITCH
- Both cooperate → both get 5% yield
- One snitches → snitch gets 50% of victim's bag
- Both snitch → both lose 25%, burned forever
- All outcomes posted publicly with wallet tags

## Structure
